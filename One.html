        <h2>Bangalore</h2>
   
    <p>Bengaluru (also called Bangalore) is the capital of India's southern Karnataka state.
         The center of India's high-tech industry, the city is also known for its parks and nightlife. 
         By Cubbon Park, Vidhana Soudha is a Neo-Dravidian legislative building. 
         Former royal residences include 19th-century Bangalore Palace, modeled after England’s Windsor Castle, 
         and Tipu Sultan’s Summer Palace, an 18th-century teak structure</p>

    <p>The city was captured by the British East India Company after v
    ictory in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War (1799), who returned administrative control
     of the city to the Maharaja of Mysore. The old city developed under the dominions 
     of the Maharaja of Mysore and was made capital of the Princely State of Mysore, 
     which existed as a nominally sovereign entity of the British Raj. In 1809, the British
      shifted their cantonment to Bangalore, outside the old city, and a town grew up around it,
       governed as part of British India. Following India's independence in 1947, Bangalore became the capital of 
       Mysore State, and remained the capital when the new Indian state of Karnataka was formed in 1956. 
       The two urban settlements of Bangalore – city and cantonment – which had developed as independent 
       entities merged into a single urban centre in 1949. The existing Kannada name, 
        Bengalūru, was declared the city's official name in 2006.</p>
